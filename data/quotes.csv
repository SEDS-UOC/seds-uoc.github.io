Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another|Plato
The history of astronomy is a history of receding horizons|Jacob Bronowski
Dark matter has a gravitational effect on other objects. You can't see it, you can't feel it, but you can watch something being pulled to its direction|Jodi Picoult 
Astronomy is the science of the harmony of infinite expanse.|John Scott Russell
A time will come when men will stretch out their eyes. They should see planets like our Earth.|Christopher Wren
Astronomy is perhaps the science whose discoveries owe least to chance, in which human understanding appears in its whole magnitude, and through which man can best learn how small he is.|Georg Christoph Lichtenberg 
Astronomy is one of the sublimest fields of human investigation. The mind that grasps its facts and principles receives something of the enlargement and grandeur belonging to the science itself. It is a quickener of devotion.|Horace Mann
We should do astronomy because it is beautiful and because it is fun. We should do it because people want to know. We want to know our place in the universe and how things happen|John N Bahcall
Astronomy is older than physics. In fact, it got physics started by showing the beautiful simplicity of the motion of the stars and planets, the understanding of which was the beginning of physics. But the most remarkable discovery in all of astronomy is that the stars are made of atoms of the same kind as those on the earth.|Richard B.Feynman
Astronomy has revealed the great truth that the whole universe is bound together by one all-pervading influence.|William Leitch
The stars, like dust, encircle me In living mists of light; And all of space I seem to see In one vast burst of sight.|Issac Asimov 
The thing I like about astronomy is being outside at night and seeing the stars in a dark sky. It makes you feel small.|Jimmy Walker 
Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.|Arthur C.Clarke 
The cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be. |Carl Sagan
The Nitrogen in our DNA, the Calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of the callapsing stars. we are made of starstuff.|Carl Sagan
To Confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit|Stephen Hawking 
Astronomy is useful because it raises us above ourselves. It is useful because it is grand..it shows how small is man's body , how great is mind, since his intelligence can embrace the whole of this dazzling immensity, where his body is only an obscure point, snd enjoy its silent harmony.|Henri Poincare
Space is for everybody. It's not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That's our new frontier out there, and it's everybody's business to know about space.|Christa McAuliffe
I find it curious that I never heard any astronauts say that he wanted to go to the Moon so he would be able to look back and see the Earth. We wanted to see what the moon looked like close up. But for most of us, the most memorable sight was not of the Moon but of our beautiful blue and white home, moving majestically around the sun, all alone and infinite black space.|Alan Bean
